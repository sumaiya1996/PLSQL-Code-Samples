---------------Wrong example of using where current of clause
declare
  cursor c_emps is select e.* from employees e, departments d
                    where 
                    e.department_id = d.department_id
                    and e.department_id = 30 for update;
begin
  for r_emps in c_emps loop
    update employees set salary = salary + 60
          where current of c_emps;
  end loop;  
end;
---------------An example of using rowid like where current of clause
declare
  cursor c_emps is select e.rowid,e.salary from employees e, departments d
                    where 
                    e.department_id = d.department_id
                    and e.department_id = 30 for update;
begin
  for r_emps in c_emps loop
    update employees set salary = salary + 60
          where rowid = r_emps.rowid;
  end loop;
